        <p>If you think of a universal language that can transcend all barriers, obviously Music scores the first place.
            Music is a divine language which helps us to put forth our prayer for peace.</p>
        <p>Maithreem Bhajata is a song that serves as a representation of world peace. It tells us how we should all
            live our lives, in the short span we have, called life.</p>
        <p>Maithreem Bhajata मैत्रीं भजत is a benediction composed in Sanskrit by Jagadguru Shri Chandrasekharendra
            Saraswati, renowned as the Paramacharya of Kanchi. The song was set to a Ragamalika by composer Shri Vasant
            Desai.</p>
        <p>It was rendered at the United Nations on Oct. 23, 1966 on the occasion of the UN day, UN-day-1966 by Bharat
            Ratna Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi and Dr. Radha Viswanathan and received a standing ovation.</p>

        <p>When this song was rendered at UNO, all the delegates from the World Nations were given the translation of
            this song. The rendering of this song by Smt. M.S. Subbulakshmi and the meaning was so melting that most of
            the delegates were moved and some of them started weeping at the profundity of the song and her voice</p>

        <p>The lines in the lyrics which says "dāmyata datta dayadhvaṃ janatāḥ" have mythological importance. </p>
        <p>Legend has it that the creator - Prajapathi had 3 sons. Namely men, demons and gods. After Prajapathi taught
            them their lessons as a father, the three groups of students approached Prajapathi and asked for one final
            lesson.</p>
        <p> When the gods approached him and asked for their lesson, he said the word "<strong>da</strong>" and asked
            them whether they understood. They said, yes, you have asked us to control our self and the "da" means
            "<strong>damyatham</strong>" or self restraint.</p>
        <p> Similarly he said the same word "da" when the other two groups approached him as well. The men understood
            "da" as "<strong>datta</strong>" which means being charitable and the demons understood "da" as
            "<strong>dayadhwam</strong>" which meant being kind.</p>
        <p> At this point a thundering sound was heard from the heavens that said "<strong>da da da, dāmyata datta
                dayadhvaṃ</strong>" which suggested the three axioms everyone of us should learn.</p>
        <large>The three “da”s -> dāmyata, “datta” and dayadhvaṃ represent qualities which humanity should nurture
            forever.</large>
        <p>Maithreem Bhajata is a song that tells us how we should all live our lives, in the short span we have, called
            life.</p>
