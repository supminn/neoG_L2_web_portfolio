        <p>If you think of a universal language that can transcend all barriers, obviously Music scores the first place.
            Music is a divine language which helps us to put forth our prayer for peace.</p>
        <p>Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system
            of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra
            Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed
            between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa and the Trinity of Carnatic music.
            Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions.</p>

    <section class="blog-section container-center off-white">
        <p>Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer
            (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a
            mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used
            in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena.</p>
        <p>You might be thinking, why should a Carnatic music singer aspire to gain knowledge of its instruments? Well,
            the answer is to obtain better focus and clarity while singing. It provides you with an upper hand on the
            “Swarasthanas” and “gamakas.”</p>
        <p>We have tried to bring out all the interesting facts here about widely used instruments in Carnatic music.
            Let’s go through the category wise to understand it better.</p>

    <section class="blog-section container-center ">
        <h2 class="quote">Drone Instrument</h2>
        <p> Their uniquesound effect lasts after seconds of actually striking the note. It is usually the first and the
            last sound of any performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Tambura: </strong> It is popularly known as Tanpura. It creates harmony in performance, unlike other
            instruments creating melody and rhythm. It also sustains the “Sur” of the composition by creating the drone
            effect.</p>
        <p>It is a long-necked plucked string instrument, originating from India, found in various forms in Indian
            music. It does not play melody but rather supports and sustains the melody of another instrument or singer
            by providing a continuous harmonic bourdon or drone.</p>
        <p>However, tamburas are increasingly being replaced by śruti boxes, and now more commonly, the electronic
            tambura.</p>

        <h2 class="quote">Stringed Instrument</h2>
        <p> They are the kind of instruments played by pulling strings attached to it in rhythm. The musician’s hands,
            stick, or a bow can be used to pluck the strings to create the sound.</p>
        <p><strong>Violin: </strong> It comprises of a hollow wooden body with generally four strings attached to it. A
            bow is used to play the strings. Its rise to fame is to be credited to western classical music. Soon it
            became indispensable in Carnatic music.</p>
        <p><strong>Veena: </strong> It goes back to Hindu mythology. Sarasvati, the Goddess of education and art, is
            always depicted carrying Veena in her hands. It’s a harmonious instrument played like Sitar.</p>
        <p><strong>Mandolin: </strong> It is a stringed musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked
            with a plectrum. It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although
            five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. This instrument was popularized in
            Carnatic music by Mandolin U Shrinivas.</p>

    <section class="blog-section container-center ">
        <h2 class="quote">Percussion Instrument</h2>
        <p> These are the types of instruments played via beating by hands, a beater stick,or against each other. It is
            the oldest form of musical instruments.</p>
        <p><strong>Mridangam: </strong> It is an ancient instrument mentioned many times in Hindu mythology. It is
            usually made up of jackfruit wood. It’s a kind of double-sided drum played by beating both sides with hands
            rhythmically.</p>
        <p><strong>Thavil: </strong> It is a prevalent instrument in South Indian ceremonies and religious events. It is
            shaped like a barrel and has two faces, like Mridangam. However, in Thavli, the more massive face is higher
            in pitch in comparison to lower.</p>
        <p><strong>Ghatam: </strong> It is based on the “Matka” or “Ghada” (pots to keep water in India, usually made of
            clay). It’s a circular pot with a narrow opening on the top from where it produces sound. It is made up of a
            special kind of clay mixed with some brass.</p>
        <p><strong>Morsing: </strong> It consists of a metal ring in the shape of a horseshoe with two parallel forks
            which form the frame. It has a metal tongue in the middle. It is played while clinching the metal tonguein
            front teeth.</p>
        <p><strong>Kanjira: </strong> The kanjira, khanjira, khanjiri or ganjira, a South Indian frame drum, is an
            instrument of the tambourine family. As a folk and bhajan instrument, it has been used in India for many
            centuries. It was modified to a frame drum with a single pair of jingles by Manpoondia Pillai.</li>

    <section class="blog-section container-center off-white">
        <h2 class="quote">Wind Instrument</h2>
        <p> It consists of a hollow body created with either brass or wood. Some columns are kept open. The player blows
            air into the mouthpiece, which makes the sound using the open columns.</p>
        <p><strong>Flute: </strong> It is deeply rooted in Hindu Mythology. The Flute was the favorite instrument of
            Lord Krishna. Itsmelodic sound helped him to attract “Gopikas” (local cowherding girls). It is popularly
            called “Bansuri” in India. It is mentioned in all 4 Vedas of the Hindu religion. It is mainly created
            through Bamboo. Custom made Flute for Carnatic Music are known as Carnatic Flutes.They are side-blown by the
            players.</p>
        <p><strong>Saxophone: </strong> It is a family of woodwind instruments usually made of brass and played with a
            single-reed mouthpiece. This instrument was popularized in Carnatic music by Dr. Kadri Gopalnath.</p>
        <p><strong>Nadaswaram: </strong> It is a double reed wind instrument from South India. It is used as a
            traditional classical instrument in Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. This instrument is
            "among the world's loudest non-brass acoustic instruments".</p>

    <section class="blog-section container-center ">
        <h2 class="quote">Reed Instrument</h2>
        <p> In these instruments, the sound is produced by vibrating a column of air. The columns are specially created
            for that purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Harmonium: </strong> It’s a keyboard instrument. Sound from Harmonium comes by vibrating a thin metal
            in a frame. Hand pumped bellows help create the sound when played according to an individual musical note.

        <h2 class="quote">Contemporary concert content</h2>
        <p>A contemporary Carnatic music concert (called a kutcheri) usually lasts about three hours, and comprises a
            number of varied compositions. Carnatic songs are composed in a particular raga, which means that they do
            not deviate from the notes in the raga. Each composition is set with specific notes and beats, but
            performers improvise extensively. Improvisation occurs in the melody of the composition as well as in using
            the notes to expound the beauty of the raga.</p>
        <p>Concerts usually begin with a varnam or an invocatory item which will act as the opening piece. The varnam is
            composed with an emphasis on swaras of the raga, but will also have lyrics, the saahityam. It is lively and
            fast to get the audience's attention. An invocatory item may usually follow the varnam.</p>
        <p>After the varnam and/or invocatory item, the artist sings longer compositions called kirtanas (commonly
            referred to as kritis). Each kriti sticks to one specific raga, although some are composed with more than
            one raga; these are known as ragamalika (a garland of ragas).</p>
        <p>After singing the opening kriti, usually, the performer sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The
            performer must improvise a string of swaras in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to
            beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The
            violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers
            must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses or
            lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can
            follow.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="blog-section container-center ">
        <p>Performers then begin the main compositions with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga. In this,
            they use the sounds aa, ri, na, ta, etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the
            raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the
            raga that shows the performer's skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then
            the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the raga. Experienced listeners can identify many
            ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the raga thus established, the song begins, usually with
            lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer
            and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In the next stage of the song, they may sing niraval or
            kalpanaswaram again.</p>
        <p>In most concerts, the main item will at least have a section at the end of the item, for the percussion to
            perform solo (called the tani avartanam). The percussion artists perform complex patterns of rhythm and
            display their skill. If multiple percussion instruments are employed, they engage in a rhythmic dialogue
            until the main performer picks up the melody once again. Some experienced artists may follow the main piece
            with a ragam thanam pallavi mid-concert, if they do not use it as the main item.</p>
        <p>Following the main composition, the concert continues with shorter and lighter songs. Some of the types of
            songs performed towards the end of the concerts are tillanas and thukkadas – bits of popular kritis or
            compositions requested by the audience. Every concert that is the last of the day ends with a mangalam, a
            thankful prayer and conclusion to the musical event.</p>

            about carnatic music was interesting.</p>
